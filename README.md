# Android Application Fruitastic

## Architecture

- **XML** is used to define the layouts of activities and user interface (UI) components.  
- The app adopts an **appealing design system** by utilizing pre-designed UI elements from [Material3](https://m3.material.io/).  
- **[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)** is implemented to manage UI-related data efficiently and ensure data survives configuration changes.  
- A **Repository pattern** is used to abstract data sources and maintain a clean separation of concerns within the app.  
- **[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)** is employed to handle API requests and parse server responses seamlessly.  
- **[Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)** is integrated to manage image loading, caching, and processing while supporting various image formats.  
- **RecyclerView Adapter** is utilized to display dynamic data in lists with efficient performance.  
- **Room Database** is used to manage local data storage.  
- **Authentication for login and registration** is implemented to secure access and personalize user experiences.  
- **Dependency Injection**.
